    Interactive only when absolutely needed, mostly on the first run.
    By default authentication is run selectively only for the portions needed.
    Hub authentication lives in the Cloud module since the authentication is obtained from
    the cloud.

    Authentication is a multistep process:
        - trigger sending OTP to email address
        - perform email login with OTP to acquire cloud token
        - acquire hub information and authenticate with hub with cloud token

        trustHub(bool): Trust current stored state of hub auth. Default True.
        remote(bool): Treat a hub as being outside the LAN, i.e. calls will be routed via the Cozify Cloud remote call system. Defaults to False.
        autoremote(bool): Autodetect hub LAN presence and flip to remote mode if needed. Defaults to True.
